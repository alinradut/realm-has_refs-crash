# Steps to reproduce

1. Open the project
2. Configure codesigning
3. Run the main app
4. Run the sharing extension, and choose any app to launch that allows you to share, such as Photos.app
5. Share a file to the "realmcrash share" application
6. Switch back to the "realmcrash" app and tap "Run test". Contents should be produced in the console telling you that the test has started and transactions are being committed.
7. Switch to the sharing extension and tap "Run test"

After a short time the sharing extension crashes hits an exception either with `Assertion failed: has_refs()` or `abort() called`.
